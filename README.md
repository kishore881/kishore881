## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kishore!

I'm a Software Engineer and I love writing code and watching it come to life.

Iâ€™m always eager to read and learn new things. While I have a few books in the queue, I mostly stay updated by reading articles and newsletters. One I highly recommend is [TLDR](https://tldr.tech/) - a Daily Tech Newsletter.
